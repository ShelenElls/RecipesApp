<!-- recipes page needs to have ingredient options populate on the create page- three options are name, image, and description
 - delete page needs to populate the assicated recipe name instead of empty quotes
 -css and html adjustments need to be made for the size of the box for value and rating
 - would be useful to have a button on the recipe detail page that adds the recipe to the meal plan 
 - list view on recipes should populate a small image of the actual recipe
